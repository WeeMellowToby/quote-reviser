# Quote Reviser

A simple Python tool I wrote to revise quotes.
The AIC quotes are incomplete and some of the quotes aren't particularly good so feel free to add your own quotes. The poetry file is different as it didn't match the format of the other texts exactly.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quote-reviser.git
cd quote-reviser
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
